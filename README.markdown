College Football Rankings
=========================

This is a repository of my college football rankings. I am in the process of providing rankings for college football going back to 1950. My current scores come from [Dr. Peter Wolfe](http://prwolfe.bol.ucla.edu/cfootball/) and my historical scores come from [James Howell College Football Scores](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rfsc/history/howell/).

The application used to compile these rankings is located [here](https://github.com/jeffself/teamrankings).
